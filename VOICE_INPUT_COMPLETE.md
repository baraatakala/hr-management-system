## 📱 Mobile UX Fixes

### **Problem 1: Input Zoom (FIXED ✅)**
**Before:** Tapping input fields on mobile caused annoying auto-zoom
**After:** 
- Font-size set to 16px on mobile (prevents iOS zoom)
- Viewport meta tag: `maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no`
- Responsive text sizing: `text-base` on mobile, `text-sm` on desktop

### **Problem 2: Form Layout (FIXED ✅)**
**Before:** 2-column layout cramped on mobile
**After:**
- Single column on mobile: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`
- Proper spacing and touch targets (44px minimum)
- Better scrolling experience

|---------|---------|
| Chrome | ✅ Excellent |

## 🎯 Tips for Best Results

### **Voice Input:**
1. **Speak clearly** - Normal pace, clear pronunciation
2. **Quiet environment** - Reduces errors
3. **Good microphone** - Better accuracy
4. **Short phrases** - Works better than long sentences
5. **Edit after** - Fix any errors from transcription

### **Numbers:**
1. **Say digits slowly** - "one... two... three..."
2. **Pause between groups** - "seven eight four... one two three..."
3. **Use "zero"** not "oh" - Clearer for recognition

### **Email:**
1. **Say "dot"** for "."
2. **Say "at"** for "@"
3. **Edit after** - Convert "at" to "@", "dot" to "."

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Firefox doesn't support voice** - Use Chrome/Edge instead
2. **Arabic voice limited on some browsers** - Chrome Android works best
3. **Numbers may transcribe as words** - "one two three" → "123" or "one two three"
4. **Email punctuation** - May need manual editing (@, .)
5. **Background noise affects accuracy** - Use quiet environment
