## 📱 Mobile Zoom Fix

### **Problem (Before):**
When you tap on an input field on mobile, the screen would zoom in automatically. Very annoying! 😤

### **Solution (Now):**
We've fixed this with **three improvements:**

#### **1. Font Size Fix**
```css
/* All inputs now use 16px font on mobile */
input, select, textarea {
  font-size: 16px !important;
}
```
**Why:** iOS Safari zooms in when font-size is less than 16px. We set it to exactly 16px!

#### **2. Viewport Meta Tag**
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="... maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no" />
```
**Why:** Prevents manual zoom and auto-zoom on input focus.

#### **3. Responsive Text Sizing**
```css
/* Desktop gets 14px (text-sm), mobile gets 16px (text-base) */
className="text-base sm:text-sm"
```
**Why:** Tailwind responsive classes ensure proper sizing per device.

## 🎨 Mobile Form Improvements

### **Before:**
- 2-column layout cramped on mobile
- Fields too small to tap accurately
- Text too small (caused zoom)
- Hard to navigate

### **After:**
- **Single column** on mobile (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`)
- **Larger touch targets** (44px minimum)
- **Bigger text** (16px prevents zoom)
- **Smooth scrolling** form

### **Desktop (Unchanged):**
- Still 2-column layout
- Still 14px text (sm:text-sm)
- Optimal for large screens
