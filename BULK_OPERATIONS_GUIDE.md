## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: Checkbox not appearing**

**Solution:** Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or F5)

---

### **Problem: Selection not highlighting**

---

### **Problem: Export button does nothing**

**Cause:** No employees selected

**Solution:** Select at least 1 employee first

---

### **Problem: "Select All" selects hidden employees**

## 🎓 Tips & Tricks

### **Tip 1: Inverse Selection**

To select all EXCEPT a few:
1. Click "Select All"
2. Manually deselect the few you don't want
3. Perform bulk action

### **Tip 2: Progressive Selection**

Build your selection across filters:
1. Filter by Company A → Select 5 employees
2. Change filter to Company B → Select 3 more
3. Now you have 8 selected across companies
4. Export or delete all 8

### **Tip 3: Export Before Delete**

**ALWAYS:**
1. Select employees for deletion
2. Export them first (backup)
3. Then delete

This gives you a recovery option if needed!
