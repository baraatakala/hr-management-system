## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Run SQL Migration in Supabase

**Before testing the new features, you MUST run this SQL:**

### Steps:
1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project: `hr-management-system`
3. Click **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy content from: `CREATE_NATIONALITIES_TABLE.sql`
6. Paste and click **Run** (or `Ctrl + Enter`)

### What it creates:
- ✅ `nationalities` table
- ✅ 14 sample countries (UAE, Saudi, Egypt, etc.)
- ✅ Indexes and security policies

**Without this, the Nationalities page and employee nationality dropdown won't work!**
