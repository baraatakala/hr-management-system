# 🎯 IMPORTANT: Next Steps to Complete Nationalities Setup

## ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED: Run SQL Migration

Before you can use the Nationalities page, you MUST run the SQL migration in Supabase.

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1️⃣ Open Supabase Dashboard

- Go to: https://app.supabase.com
- Select your project: **hr-management-system**

### 2️⃣ Navigate to SQL Editor

- Click on **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
- Click **New Query** button

### 3️⃣ Copy the SQL Code

- Open the file: `CREATE_NATIONALITIES_TABLE.sql` (in project root)
- **Copy ALL the content**

### 4️⃣ Paste and Run

- Paste the SQL code into the editor
- Click **Run** button (or press `Ctrl + Enter`)
- Wait for confirmation message

### 5️⃣ Verify It Worked

Run this query to check:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM nationalities;
```

You should see: `total: 14`

---

## ✅ What the SQL Does

1. **Creates `nationalities` table** with:

   - `id` (UUID primary key)
   - `code` (unique country code)
   - `name_en` (English name)
   - `name_ar` (Arabic name)
   - `created_at` (timestamp)

2. **Inserts 14 sample countries**:

   - UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon
   - Syria, Palestine, India, Pakistan, Philippines
   - USA, UK, Canada, Australia

3. **Sets up security**:
   - Row Level Security (RLS)
   - Policies for authenticated users
   - Indexes for performance

## 🚀 After Running SQL

Once the SQL runs successfully:

1. **Refresh your browser** or restart the dev server
2. **Visit:** http://localhost:5175/nationalities
3. **You should see:**
   - 14 nationality cards
   - "Add Nationality" button
   - Edit/Delete buttons on each card
   - Bilingual display
