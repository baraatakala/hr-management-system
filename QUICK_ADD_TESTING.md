## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Quick Add" button doesn't appear
**Cause:** Error message format doesn't match pattern  
**Check:** Error message should be exactly: `Nationality "Value" not found`  
**Solution:** Update validation error messages to match format

### Issue: Row doesn't re-validate after adding
**Cause:** Database query failed or reference list not refreshed  
**Check:** Browser console for errors  
**Solution:** Check Supabase connection and query invalidation

### Issue: Modal doesn't open
**Cause:** `quickAddDialog` state not set correctly  
**Check:** Browser console for errors  
**Solution:** Verify `setQuickAddDialog()` is called with correct params

### Issue: Duplicate code error persists
**Cause:** Code already exists in database  
**Check:** Go to reference data page and verify  
**Solution:** Use different code or delete existing item first

## Success Criteria

✅ "Quick Add" button appears for missing reference data errors  
✅ Modal opens with pre-filled English name  
✅ Form validation works (required fields, duplicate detection)  
✅ Successfully adds item to database  
✅ Row automatically re-validates after add  
✅ Row status changes from ❌ error to ✓ ready  
✅ Import succeeds after fixing all errors  
✅ New reference data appears in respective pages  
✅ No TypeScript errors in browser console  
✅ Works for all 4 types: nationality, company, department, job
